## Requirements for Participation

### 1. Operating System
A Linux or macOS system, or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) if you are on Windows.

### 2. GitHub Account
Your GitHub account must be active and meet the following criteria:

+ Your account must be at least a month old.
+ Your account must have at least one public repository.
+ Your account must follow at least 5 GitHub accounts and have at least 1 follower.
+ You must allow the ceremony tools to read and write GitHub Gists on your account.

### 3. Internet Connection
A stable and reliable internet connection is required. The most common cause of failure is a timeout due to slow or unstable uploads. To avoid this, ensure you have a good upload bandwidth while participating in the ceremony.

Tips:
+ Use VPS if you can't keep your PC & internet open 24/7 till you contribute
+ Use PC if you can.

## Common Steps after installing Dependencies for MacOS, Linux, WSL

### 2. Install NVMâ€¨

source .bashrc
```

### 3. Install Node.js 18â€¨

nvm use 18
```
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 4. Install Ceremony

Step 1. Create a directory in your home folder to run the ceremony from:
```
mkdir ~/trusted-setup-tmp && cd ~/trusted-setup-tmp
```
Step 2: Install CLI:
```
npm install -g @p0tion/phase2cli
```
Step 3: Authenticate with GitHub:

To contribute to the ceremony, youâ€™ll need a legit GitHub account as per requirements mentioned above.
Run this command in your terminal:
```
phase2cli auth
```

+ This will prompt you to open a browser and visitÂ https://github.com/login/device
+ Copy the provided auth code in terminal and paste in the auth page . Click "Authorize ethstorage" to continue.


### 5. Contribute Ceremony

* Open a screen (For VPS only)

Open a screen so the ceremony keeps going in the background, it might take hours before itâ€™s your turn.

Screen is useful for VPS only, not WSL or MacOS. If you close the terminal in WSL, your screen session is killed
```
screen -S ceremony
```

#### Contribute to the ceremony (ALL)
```
phase2cli contribute -c ethstorage-v1-trusted-setup-ceremony
```

You can either hit enter for randomly, or pick manually and type any letter or number yourself.

## Screen commands

Minimize screen:Â Ctrl+A+D
Return to screen:Â ```screen -r ceremony```

## Notes:

+ Contributing may take some time, depending on the current queue of contributors.
+ If your connection is interrupted or an error occurs, simply re-run the same command â€” it will pick up from where it left off.

After completing your contribution, you will be invited to share a message on X or your preferred social platform! ðŸŽ‰


## Cleanup & Logout

After completing your contribution to the ceremony, itâ€™s recommended to clean up your local files and revoke GitHub authorization for security:
```
phase2cli clean
phase2cli logout
```
Delete the ceremony folder too if you donâ€™t need it:
```
rm -rf ~/trusted-setup-tmp
```
ALL DONE!
